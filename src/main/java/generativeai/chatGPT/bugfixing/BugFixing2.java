		/*
		 * Discuss
		 * 
		 * OK, ready to discuss the file BugFixing2.java. What would you like to ask?
		 * 
		 * do you see any issues with the code? Yes, there is an issue with the code.
		 * 
		 * In the BugFixing2 class, the code tries to use the toList() method on the
		 * Stream object to convert the stream into a list. However, the toList() method
		 * is not available in Java versions prior to Java 16.
		 * 
		 * To fix this issue, you can either upgrade your Java version to Java 16 or
		 * later, or you can use alternative methods to convert the stream into a list,
		 * such as collect(Collectors.toList()):
		 * List<String> l = Stream.generate(() -> "echo").collect(Collectors.toList());
